# Data interoperability with Large Language Models

This repository stores and displays the different prompts used to develop the methodology presented in the paper *Data Interoperability with Large Language Models*.

The file structure is organized as follows:

- **Experiment1**: Contains the resources used for Experiment 1.
  - **Experiment1/Prompts**: Holds the various prompts used to interact with the LLM.
  - **Experiment1/Mappings**: Contains the complete results for each of the different prompts and LLM models used.
- **Experiment2**: Contains the resources used for Experiment 2.
  - **Experiment2/Clustering**: Includes the different clusters generated and the HL7 FHIR resources most similar to each cluster after applying the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology.
  - **Experiment2/Prompts**: Holds the prompts used to interact with the LLM.
  - **Experiment2/Mappings**: Shows the different results obtained for each of the LLMs used.
